Hi!

This repo includes: 

* May 2019: slides from my (Emily Hopkins') presentations on Wed. May 1 2019 -- the HR intro, the SIMSSA overview, and the software licensing introduction. 

* July 2020 slides for the Licensing Hackathon as we make our licensing more consistent for software, documentation, and symbolic scores across the whole DDMAL organization.

As an example, this repository is licensed using the MIT License. You can add a license to your GitHub repo following this tutorial: https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository
This repo also includes an example file (hello-simssa.py) showing how you can include the MIT license in your code. 
You should have a license for the whole repo as well as the license text in all your files. 

# Remember, if people can't figure out if they're allowed to use your stuff, they might not use it! That means NO CITATIONS! ;_;
