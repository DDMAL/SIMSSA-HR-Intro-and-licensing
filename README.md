Hi!

This repo includes the slides from my (Emily Hopkins') presentations on Wed. May 1 -- the HR intro, the SIMSSA overview, and the software licensing introduction.

As an example, this repository is licensed using the MIT License. You can add a license to your GitHub repo following this tutorial: https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository
This repo also includes an example file (hello-simssa.py) showing how you can include the MIT license in your code. 
You should have a license for the whole repo as well as the license text in all your files.
